<p>SAN DIEGO — Have you experienced an aerial phenomenon? If you ask some San Diegans that question, their answer would be “yes.”</p>
<p>According to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nuforc.org/" target="_blank">National UFO Reporting Center</a> (NUFORC), several unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings in the region have been reported so far this year.</p>
<p>NUFORC is a non-governmental, non-profit corporation that investigates UFO sightings. The center says it receives, records, corroborates and documents reports from individuals who believe they have witnessed an aerial phenomenon.</p>

<p>Since it was founded in 1974, NUFORC says it has processed over 170,000 reports, which are listed online by date and location. The center explained that guaranteed anonymity to callers is a longstanding policy of the corporation. </p>
<p>NUFORC makes available to the public all of its data in summary form with the time, location, duration of the sighting and a short summary describing the UFO.</p>
<p>As of Aug. 6, 2023, there have been a total of 15 UFO sightings across San Diego County that have been reported to NUFORC this year.</p>

<p>EL CAJON, Calif. — Just one day after <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/traffic/san-diego-city-council-approves-smart-streetlights-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">San Diego city officials approved the use of 500 Smart Streetlights</a>, the City of El Cajon is gearing up to start using its new cameras to track license plates.</p>
<p>Forty new sets of eyes — by way of surveillance cameras — will soon call the streets of El Cajon home. The cameras will track license plates in real time, an effort police say to get criminals off the streets quicker.</p>
<p>“Time is the biggest impact on our job, time to investigate crimes and having this real-time information to respond immediately to get people in custody or recover stolen property,” said Lt. Jeremiah Larson with the El Cajon Police Department.</p>
<p>Police activated the cameras for a brief test run last week and say in that short time, the cameras tracked two cars that were reported in violent crimes — one was involved in a carjacking and robbery and another was a stolen vehicle.</p>
<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

		Police dog killed in ‘violent shooting’; suspect pronounced dead	</a><br />
</aside>
</div>
<p>Police say thanks to the cameras, the suspects were arrested.</p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>“We take public safety very seriously in El Cajon. We have a fully staffed police department and we are doing everything we can to keep things as safe as possible, so that means we’re are going to do everything at our disposal to keep criminals off our streets,” El Cajon Mayor Bill Wells said.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab">
</aside>
<p>For some people, the new technology feels like an invasion of privacy. Some residents worry the tracking goes too far.</p>
<p>Others, however, say anything that helps keep police keep criminals off the streets, the better.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind it, they’re already tracking us on our cell phone, just an added layer of security, don’t think it’ll impact us in El Cajon,” Charlie Galaviz said.</p>
<p>“I think that’s awesome, less people I have to worry about, the better for my family…the hard working people of El Cajon,” Patricia Joyce said.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr2_ab">
</aside>
<p>Police say the cameras will not track anything but license plates, and that information is deleted after 30 days unless it’s connected to a car involved in a crime.</p>
<p>The cameras are expected to be up and officially running by the end of the month.</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO — Tropical Storm Eugene is brewing off the Baja California coast and is moving west-northwest, which could mean rain and isolated storms midweek for parts of San Diego County.</p>
<p>That’s according to the National Hurricane Center, which also warned of the possibility of Eugene becoming a hurricane Sunday. Weather officials now anticipate the storm to weaken into Monday.</p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>San Diego temperatures proved warm Sunday, especially in the inland areas with some areas hitting highs in the triple digits, the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/sgx/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Weather Service</a> reported. The region’s desert also remained under an Excessive Heat Warning with NWS warning of “dangerously hot conditions.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, weather officials say those in the region can expect more humidity and muggy conditions into Wednesday as Tropical Storm Eugene weakens. According to NWS, the diminishing tropical storm may provide a chance for isolated showers and storms midweek. </p>
<p>Though NWS expressed lower confidence on the possibility of rain, weather officials say mugginess is highly likely as remnants of Tropical Storm Eugene trek northward. Nonetheless, weather officials say brief heavy downpours and lightening are possible throughout the county.</p>
<p>For San Diego’s mountains, NWS anticipates gusty winds Monday evening through Tuesday evening with peak gusts possibly reaching between 35 to 55 mph. Weather officials advised motorist to “drive with care and watch for any blowing dust.”</p>
