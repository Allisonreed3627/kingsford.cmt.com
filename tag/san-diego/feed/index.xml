<p>SAN DIEGO — Have you experienced an aerial phenomenon? If you ask some San Diegans that question, their answer would be “yes.”</p>
<p>According to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nuforc.org/" target="_blank">National UFO Reporting Center</a> (NUFORC), several unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings in the region have been reported so far this year.</p>
<p>NUFORC is a non-governmental, non-profit corporation that investigates UFO sightings. The center says it receives, records, corroborates and documents reports from individuals who believe they have witnessed an aerial phenomenon.</p>

<p>Since it was founded in 1974, NUFORC says it has processed over 170,000 reports, which are listed online by date and location. The center explained that guaranteed anonymity to callers is a longstanding policy of the corporation. </p>
<p>NUFORC makes available to the public all of its data in summary form with the time, location, duration of the sighting and a short summary describing the UFO.</p>
<p>As of Aug. 6, 2023, there have been a total of 15 UFO sightings across San Diego County that have been reported to NUFORC this year.</p>

<p>Here’s a detailed breakdown of those alleged sightings, according to NUFORC:</p>
<p><em>*The National UFO Reporting Center says it makes no claims as to the validity of the information in any of these reports. Obvious hoaxes have been omitted, however, most reports have been posted exactly as received in the author’s own words.</em></p>
