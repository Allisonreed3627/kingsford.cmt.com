Dodgers manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the plan is for Kershaw to make his first start since June 27 \u201csometime in the middle of the week.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out this rotation for Arizona, for Colorado and talk through it,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut now I feel good in saying for him to make a start this week is most likely going to happen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Right-hander Tony Gonsolin is scheduled to start the series finale in San Diego on Monday afternoon with left-hander Julio Urias and rookie right-hander Bobby Miller in line to start the two-game series in Arizona on Tuesday and Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>Kershaw could start one of those days, pushing Urias and\/or Miller back a day. But he doesn\u2019t have the most encouraging history at Chase Field \u2013 an 8-11 record and 3.91 ERA in 22 career starts there. It is one of just two stadiums where Kershaw has a losing record (St.\u00a0Louis\u2019 Busch Stadium is the other). The Dodgers could wait for the friendly confines of Dodger Stadium to start Kershaw on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Kershaw has insisted for some time that his shoulder feels fine and he could pitch through whatever Dr. Neal ElAttrache detected in an MRI right before the All-Star break (Kershaw won\u2019t talk in specifics about what was found). But the midseason break has become a standard part of Kershaw\u2019s seasons now. He has not made more than 22 starts in a season since 2019, a total that he might surpass narrowly this season.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d want to hear that,\u201d Roberts said of Kershaw, who made 16 starts before going on the IL. \u201cHe works extremely hard to take down every start. But it just hasn\u2019t played out that way in the last few years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, when he\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s as good as anyone. At different times, different years, different things have kind of put him on the IL, just truthfully. I know he\u2019s frustrated with it, because some of the things are out of his power. But I really don\u2019t know what to say. When he\u2019s healthy, I love having him out there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Looming over every Kershaw start will be the question of how much longer the Dodgers will have him out there. The 35-year-old future Hall of Famer is on a one-year contract for the second consecutive season and has made it clear continuing his career is a yearly decision at this point. How healthy he proves to be over the next three months will certainly affect that decision.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a big factor. Obviously, No. 1 is health,\u201d Roberts agreed. \u201cThe performance is the performance, which we\u2019ve come to know and expect. But it\u2019s a big couple months for him and his decision-making, for sure.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think right now with where he\u2019s at, all that stuff plays into the potential career stuff. \u2026 You never know. So with that, I enjoy all my conversations, watching him pitch. Because the truth is, he can make this decision at any point in time. \u2026 I don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"\">MUNCY MENDING<\/h4>\n<p>Third baseman Max Muncy was out of the lineup for the third consecutive day Sunday. Muncy has not played since being hit in the left wrist by a pitch Thursday. But he took batting practice in the cage for the first time since the injury Sunday and could be back in the lineup Monday.<\/p>\n<p>Muncy said he has had multiple examinations to make sure there is not a small fracture in the wrist that might have been undetected. All have come back negative.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt hit me in a terrible spot,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cIt kind of locked up my wrist for two days. Now it\u2019s about pain control.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"\">ALSO<\/h4>\n<p>Right-hander Michael Grove was placed on the IL on Sunday with tightness in the latissimus muscle behind his right shoulder.
