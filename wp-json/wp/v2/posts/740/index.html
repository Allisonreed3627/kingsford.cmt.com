A fan reaching over the railing caught the first fly ball, a home run by J.P. Crawford on Chase Silseth\u2019s first pitch of the game. The other was dropped by Angels right fielder Hunter Renfroe on the warning track, an unsightly error that put Cal Raleigh on second base.<\/p>\n<p>The calamitous first inning did not foreshadow the game that followed. Silseth and Seattle\u2019s Bryce Miller engaged in a duel of 2021 draft picks, keeping the score low and the tension high before an announced crowd of 29,960.<\/p>\n<p>The Angels lost anyway, 3-2 in 10 innings, extending their losing streak to six and furthering their tumble down the American League standings. They are 7 games behind the Toronto Blue Jays in the wild-card race and 10 \u00bd games behind the Texas Rangers in the AL West.<\/p>\n<p>The Angels (56-57) had not been swept by Seattle (60-52) in a four-game series since July 7-10, 2005. They had not been under .500 since July 17.<\/p>\n<p>The Mariners scored the winning run in the 10th inning when Eugenio Suarez punched a single into left field to score Ty France, the automatic runner on second base.<\/p>\n<p>Julio Rodriguez, who was intentionally walked to get to Suarez, was tagged out at third base when his foot briefly lost contact with the bag. Barr\u00eda (2-6) then retired Cal Raleigh on a lineout to end the inning.<\/p>\n<p>In the bottom of the 10th, an automatic runner on second base did nothing to help the Angels against left-hander Tayler Saucedo. Hunter Renfroe was called out on strikes. Chad Wallach flew out to left field. C.J. Cron struck out swinging, ending the game.<\/p>\n<p>Silseth did nearly everything in his power to halt the Angels\u2019 losing streak. His 12 strikeouts were a career high. He walked one batter and allowed only four hits in seven innings.<\/p>\n<p>After Crawford\u2019s opening drive, the Mariners did not score again until Teoscar Hernandez hammered a 96-mph fastball into the bullpen area in the seventh inning. The solo home run gave Seattle a short-lived 2-1 lead.<\/p>\n<p>In the bottom of the seventh, Angels catcher Matt Thaiss parked a towering 419-foot home run in the right-field bleachers. The game was tied again, 2-2.<\/p>\n<p>Since rejoining the Angels\u2019 starting rotation July 19, Silseth has allowed 4 runs in 17 2\/3 innings (a 2.04 ERA) while striking out 26 and walking three. This was his first no-decision following a pair of wins, because Miller was every bit his equal.<\/p>\n<p>The Angels mounted a threat in the bottom of the first inning. With one out, Shohei Ohtani and Brandon Drury singled, putting runners on first and second. Mike Moustakas poked a line drive to the opposite field, and Ohtani scored easily to tie the game 1-1.<\/p>\n<p>Drury held up at third base as the throw came in from left field, before Miller struck out Randal Grichuk and Mickey Moniak to strand the runners at second and third. The Angels put only one other runner in scoring position before the 10th inning.<\/p>\n<p>Matt Moore pitched a scoreless eighth inning, and Carlos Estevez worked around a single and a walk in a scoreless ninth.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"related left\"\/><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ANAHEIM \u2015 The Seattle Mariners hit two pitches to deep right field in the first inning Sunday at Angel Stadium.
