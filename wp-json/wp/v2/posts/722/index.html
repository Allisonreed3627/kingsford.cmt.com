As the investigation into what went wrong continued, Long Beach resident Cory Valdes described his efforts to assist in the aftermath of the Saturday afternoon explosion.<\/p>\n<p>Valdes \u2014 retired from the Coast Guard and often at the marina \u2014 said he was on his friend\u2019s small boat as he watched the 35-foot powerboat at the Alamitos Bay fueling dock suddenly explode into flames.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt went up so fast \u2014 you are talking ten, fifteen seconds and it was fully engulfed,\u201d Valdes said. \u201cI just knew we had to go over there and help.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was so loud, it shook us,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>One man was quickly able to get off the boat and onto the dock, Valdes recalled, while a second man was able to move onto the back of the powerboat and jump into the water before the flames spread. A woman also was able to leap into the bay.<\/p>\n<p>Valdes focused on helping the man who had made it onto the dock get the struggling woman out of the water, he said, while his friend pulled his small vessel around to help the other man still partially submerged.<\/p>\n<p>The woman appeared to be in shock, Valdes said, while the man said, \u201cThere are two more on board\u201d over and over. Meanwhile, two fuel attendants had grabbed fire extinguishers and were unsuccessfully attempting to douse the flames, he added.<\/p>\n<p>Valdes said he helped run up the gangway to get a hose, which they used to try to keep the flames in check until a fire boat arrived with a water cannon.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou know there are the other two on board, you are hearing yelling, you think you are hearing screaming \u2014 it was just a poor, sad situation,\u201d Valdes said.<\/p>\n<p>As the flames went down, Valdes helped tie the damaged vessel against the dock, and said he told the arriving firefighters that there were still at least two people on board the boat. The fire crews initially struggled to find the women on the vessel, he added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe did everything possible we could to prevent further loss of life and property,\u201d Valdes said.<\/p>\n<p>Long Beach Fire Captain and spokesman Jake Heflin said Sunday the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, though based on witness statements is believed to have occurred during the fueling process or immediately after.<\/p>\n<p>Both fire officials and Valdes noted that fueling can be dangerous if the engine of the vessel is restarted before fuel vapors dissipate.<\/p>\n<p>Valdes said he was surprised at the size of the explosion.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn this big of a boat, to blow up like that, it is unusual,\u201d Valdes said. \u201cYou might see it in a smaller boat, but you don\u2019t see it so much in big, 35-foot yachts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Based on his experience and what he witnessed, Valdes said he believes the explosion may have stunned or knocked unconscious the women inside the boat, while the rapid spread of the flames prevented the other three from getting to them.<\/p>\n<p>The three survivors were hospitalized on Saturday. Officials on Sunday said they did not have any updates about their condition. The two women who died have not yet been publicly identified.<\/p>\n<p>Capt. Heflin said crews attempted to tow the boat to an isolation dock, but the vessel took on water and became partially submerged. Salvage crews are expected to help remove it from the water.<\/p>\n<p>Valdes, who has his own small boat at the marina, said the incident is a reminder of how important it is to always pay attention while boating and make sure equipment is kept in order.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTake boating seriously all the time,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p><em>Staff columnist Jo Murray contributed to this report.<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"related left\"\/><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A deadly explosion and fire on a pleasure boat at a refueling dock in Long Beach left the vessel engulfed in flames within seconds, a retired Coast Guard crew member who took part in rescue efforts said Sunday.
