Working as the first-team left guard, Avila often finds himself matched up with the three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year during one-on-one pass blocking and 11-on-11 scrimmages.<\/p>\n<p>The results, to put it kindly, have been mixed. More often than not, Avila finds himself pushed far off his block, if not blown by and needing to resort to tugging at Donald\u2019s jersey. So Avila can provide a dose of reality to any other amateurs wondering what he once did.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you, it\u2019s zero,\u201d Avila says with a wry smile. \u201cI was a victim of having that mentality in college with a couple of my buddies. I was like, \u2018Eh, maybe two.\u2019 The answer is zero.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If not a baptism by fire, it\u2019s been one by 280 pounds of muscle and nine years of experience for Avila. But it\u2019s a necessary one for the second-round draft pick whom the Rams will rely on heavily in the coming season.<\/p>\n<p>After earning consensus All-American honors and not giving up a sack as a senior in Fort Worth, Avila stood out to the Rams\u2019 front office and coaching staff for his communication up front, his ability to play multiple positions and, most of all, his toughness.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be glass eaters or anything like that,\u201d offensive line coach Ryan Wendell said. \u201cBut if you want to be an NFL offensive lineman, you have to be looking for contact on every play. That\u2019s what we saw from Steve on film. He\u2019s got no problem putting his face in and hitting people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Though they considered moving up into the first round, the Rams stayed put at the 36th overall pick. Avila was at the top of their board when Day 2 of the NFL draft began, and they scooped him up when their turn on the clock came.<\/p>\n<p>Now preparing for his rookie year, Avila reminds himself that he doesn\u2019t have to worry about returning to class in a couple of weeks. All of his time can be devoted to his craft and learning the Rams\u2019 offense.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is literally all I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s a lot easier to go back and watch film for a little more time, it\u2019s a lot easier to go over the plays a little more,\u201d Avila said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more weight off your shoulders.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s still the adjustment. It\u2019s still football, but Avila is taking in new techniques and finding his footing in the NFL speed of play, and against tougher competition.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSteve still has a long way to go, like we all do,\u201d Wendell said. \u201cBut he approaches it the right way every day in the sense that that guy comes, it\u2019s never too big for him, he\u2019s got a real level personality. Each day he\u2019s taking in notes, he\u2019s working on little things and you see improvement daily.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to help the team where I can and I feel like I was drafted for a reason and I feel like that was to start and to contribute,\u201d Avila said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I just want to be great. I\u2019ve got people back home I want to make proud, I\u2019ve got expectations for myself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And there\u2019s no better teacher for Avila than daily sessions against Donald as he prepares for his first taste of in-game competition this week with Saturday\u2019s preseason opener against the Chargers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re made of the right stuff like Steve is, then you embrace that competition every day,\u201d offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur said. \u201cYeah, [Donald]\u2019s the best to ever do it inside and I truly believe that, and I think most people believe that. So for [Avila] just to go and battle, don\u2019t try to make stuff up versus Aaron. You got to just go play your game.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"\">BRIEFLY<\/h4>\n<p>Right tackle Rob Havenstein was held out of practice with a sore neck as a precautionary measure, per a team spokesperson, while Donald, receiver Van Jefferson and center Brian Allen received veteran rest days.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"related left\"\/><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>IRVINE \u2014 Back in college at TCU, Steve Avila and his linemates used to wonder: If given 10 opportunities, how many times could they successfully block Aaron Donald?
