<p>SAN DIEGO — Have you experienced an aerial phenomenon? If you ask some San Diegans that question, their answer would be “yes.”</p>
<p>According to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nuforc.org/" target="_blank">National UFO Reporting Center</a> (NUFORC), several unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings in the region have been reported so far this year.</p>
<p>NUFORC is a non-governmental, non-profit corporation that investigates UFO sightings. The center says it receives, records, corroborates and documents reports from individuals who believe they have witnessed an aerial phenomenon.</p>

<p>Since it was founded in 1974, NUFORC says it has processed over 170,000 reports, which are listed online by date and location. The center explained that guaranteed anonymity to callers is a longstanding policy of the corporation. </p>
<p>NUFORC makes available to the public all of its data in summary form with the time, location, duration of the sighting and a short summary describing the UFO.</p>
<p>As of Aug. 6, 2023, there have been a total of 15 UFO sightings across San Diego County that have been reported to NUFORC this year.</p>

<p>Here’s a detailed breakdown of those alleged sightings, according to NUFORC:</p>

<p>Fire crews were battling a 20-acre fire called the Broadway Fire that had spread from a structure fire near Broadway Street and Esperanza Avenue earlier that night.</p>
<p>Both helicopters involved crews that were contracted with CAL FIRE to fight fires across the state.</p>
<p>“I would like to express our deepest sympathies and sorrow to the families and the coworkers of the personnel,” said a CAL FIRE/Riverside County Fire spokesperson. “This was a tragic loss for the community. We think about this and how it affects the families. They have lost three great individuals — three fathers, three husbands, three friends, three sons. We want to tell everyone while their sacrifice should not be in vain, that we think about them and we will support them.”</p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the crash remain under investigation. Authorities confirmed the helicopter that crashed was a water-dropping aircraft.</p>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Board has taken over the investigation. More details are expected Monday morning.</p>

<div>
<p>SAN DIEGO — Clayton Kershaw has thrown too many bullpen sessions to get excited about one – even if it’s the last box to be checked before he can return to the rotation.</p>
<p>“I did it,” Kershaw said with a wry smile after throwing in the bullpen at Petco Park before Sunday’s game. “I’ll be ready for whatever is next.”</p>
<p>Coming off the injured list and rejoining the rotation is next. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the plan is for Kershaw to make his first start since June 27 “sometime in the middle of the week.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got to figure out this rotation for Arizona, for Colorado and talk through it,” Roberts said. “But now I feel good in saying for him to make a start this week is most likely going to happen.”</p>
<p>Right-hander Tony Gonsolin is scheduled to start the series finale in San Diego on Monday afternoon with left-hander Julio Urias and rookie right-hander Bobby Miller in line to start the two-game series in Arizona on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kershaw could start one of those days, pushing Urias and/or Miller back a day. But he doesn’t have the most encouraging history at Chase Field – an 8-11 record and 3.91 ERA in 22 career starts there. It is one of just two stadiums where Kershaw has a losing record (St. Louis’ Busch Stadium is the other). The Dodgers could wait for the friendly confines of Dodger Stadium to start Kershaw on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kershaw has insisted for some time that his shoulder feels fine and he could pitch through whatever Dr. Neal ElAttrache detected in an MRI right before the All-Star break (Kershaw won’t talk in specifics about what was found). But the midseason break has become a standard part of Kershaw’s seasons now. He has not made more than 22 starts in a season since 2019, a total that he might surpass narrowly this season.</p>
<p>“I don’t think he’d want to hear that,” Roberts said of Kershaw, who made 16 starts before going on the IL. “He works extremely hard to take down every start. But it just hasn’t played out that way in the last few years.</p>
<p>“For me, when he’s healthy, he’s as good as anyone. At different times, different years, different things have kind of put him on the IL, just truthfully. I know he’s frustrated with it, because some of the things are out of his power. But I really don’t know what to say. When he’s healthy, I love having him out there.”</p>
<p>Looming over every Kershaw start will be the question of how much longer the Dodgers will have him out there. The 35-year-old future Hall of Famer is on a one-year contract for the second consecutive season and has made it clear continuing his career is a yearly decision at this point. How healthy he proves to be over the next three months will certainly affect that decision.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a big factor. Obviously, No. 1 is health,” Roberts agreed. “The performance is the performance, which we’ve come to know and expect. But it’s a big couple months for him and his decision-making, for sure.</p>
<p>“I think right now with where he’s at, all that stuff plays into the potential career stuff. … You never know. So with that, I enjoy all my conversations, watching him pitch. Because the truth is, he can make this decision at any point in time. … I don’t take it for granted.”</p>
<h4 class="">MUNCY MENDING</h4>
<p>Third baseman Max Muncy was out of the lineup for the third consecutive day Sunday. Muncy has not played since being hit in the left wrist by a pitch Thursday. But he took batting practice in the cage for the first time since the injury Sunday and could be back in the lineup Monday.</p>
<p>Muncy said he has had multiple examinations to make sure there is not a small fracture in the wrist that might have been undetected. All have come back negative.</p>
<p>“It hit me in a terrible spot,” Muncy said. “It kind of locked up my wrist for two days. Now it’s about pain control.”</p>
<h4 class="">ALSO</h4>
<p>Right-hander Michael Grove was placed on the IL on Sunday with tightness in the latissimus muscle behind his right shoulder. Left-hander Bryan Hudson was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City where he 5-0 with a 2.61 ERA and 66 strikeouts in 41⅓ innings this year.</p>
<h4 class="">UP NEXT</h4>
<p>Dodgers (RHP Tony Gonsolin, 6-4, 4.11 ERA) at Padres (RHP Seth Lugol, 4-5, 3.54  ERA), Monday, 1:10 p.m., SportsNet LA, MLB Network, 570 AM</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO — The Dodgers and Padres went car shopping at the trade deadline and each drove off with a high-mileage, used vehicle.</p>
<p>Between them, 43-year-old Rich Hill and 36-year-old Lance Lynn had logged more than 3,200 innings in the big leagues before joining their latest new teams this week. Matched up Sunday at Petco Park, the Dodgers took the new-car shine off their former teammate, scoring six times in the first two innings against Hill on the way to an 8-2 victory over the Padres.</p>
<p>“We knew we had to get there early because we knew shadows were coming. That’s kind of the big thing in these games with the weird start times,” Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman said of the 4:10 p.m. start for the ESPN broadcast. “You’ve got to score runs early because we know it’s going to be hard in the middle part of the game. We were able to do that.”</p>
<p>In his second start for the Dodgers, Lynn looked even better than he did in his debut against the lowly Oakland A’s. He allowed just one run on four hits and two walks while striking out six in six innings.</p>
<p>The Padres made their fair share of hard contact – four outs in the first five innings left the bat at 97 mph or higher – and Lynn got just six swing-and-misses in 96 pitches. But they scored just once, on a solo home run (of course) by Gary Sanchez, inflating Lynn’s major league-leading total to 32 home runs allowed this season.</p>
<p>“That’s the reason we acquired him, is to go out there and pound the strike zone, go deep into games,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.</p>
<p>If Lynn has done what the Dodgers wanted from him, so have Amed Rosario and Kiké Hernandez.</p>
<p>Acquired to pump up the Dodgers’ production against left-handed pitching, Rosario and Hernandez have gone a combined 19 for 60 (.317) with seven doubles (five by Hernandez) and two home runs (both from Rosario) and 15 RBIs. Most importantly, the Dodgers have faced six left-handed starting pitchers since Rosario made his debut last week and won four of those games, averaging nearly seven runs per game.</p>
<p>“Just seems like everyone we run out there takes a professional at-bat, can take a walk, can slug if we need to, can hit to the other side of the field,” Roberts said. “I feel really good about where we’re at.</p>
<p>“I think it was actually the perfect storm in the sense that we got a run of lefties in a week where these guys got a chance to get acclimated, to play. Not sit around and wait. So they got thrust into the fire. To their credit, they’ve performed.”</p>
<p>The echoes from Pearl Jam’s “Even Flow” (Hill’s warmup song) had barely faded before Hill’s debut with his 13th MLB team started to go badly. He hit Freddie Freeman with a 72 mph curveball and served up a two-run home run to Rosario on a fly ball that dropped into the “Petco Porch” just inside the right field foul pole.</p>
<p>Singles by Hernandez and Miguel Rojas put runners at the corners with one out in the second inning. Austin Barnes drove in a run with a bunt – the call on the play at the plate overturned when it was ruled Padres catcher Gary Sanchez had blocked the plate against Hernandez.</p>
<p>Two batters later, Hill got ahead 0-and-2 on Freeman but couldn’t put him away. On the 10th pitch of the at-bat, Freeman drove a three-run home run into the right field seats and Hill’s debut with the Padres fit the team’s season-long theme of disappointment. He was out of the game after three innings and 77 pitches, having retired just nine of the first 17 batters he faced while wearing Padres camo.</p>
<p>“I got down 0-2 pretty quick so I was just trying to move it forward and hopefully something good would happen,” Freeman said. “But I started seeing more and more pitches, fouled off the heaters away then I took that 2-2 curveball. I saw that one pretty good. We knew from our hitters’ meeting that he was heavy breaking ball 3-2, so I was just kind of looking up in the zone and hoping to see something pop. I saw something pop and I was able to get it.”</p>
<p>The Dodgers’ offense went silent in the shadows against reliever Pedro Avila who struck out seven in 4⅔ innings before Mookie Betts’ solo home run in the eighth inning. It was Betts’ 30th of the season.</p>
<p>According to ESPN Stats and Info, Freeman and Betts are the first pair of Dodgers teammates to each have 60 extra-base hits through the team’s first 110 games of a season since Babe Herman and Johnny Frederick in 1929. Freeman has 65, Betts 60.</p>

<div>
<p>IRVINE — Back in college at TCU, Steve Avila and his linemates used to wonder: If given 10 opportunities, how many times could they successfully block Aaron Donald?</p>
<p>Through two weeks as a rookie with the Rams, he has gotten his answer. Working as the first-team left guard, Avila often finds himself matched up with the three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year during one-on-one pass blocking and 11-on-11 scrimmages.</p>
<p>The results, to put it kindly, have been mixed. More often than not, Avila finds himself pushed far off his block, if not blown by and needing to resort to tugging at Donald’s jersey. So Avila can provide a dose of reality to any other amateurs wondering what he once did.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna tell you, it’s zero,” Avila says with a wry smile. “I was a victim of having that mentality in college with a couple of my buddies. I was like, ‘Eh, maybe two.’ The answer is zero.”</p>
<p>If not a baptism by fire, it’s been one by 280 pounds of muscle and nine years of experience for Avila. But it’s a necessary one for the second-round draft pick whom the Rams will rely on heavily in the coming season.</p>
<p>After earning consensus All-American honors and not giving up a sack as a senior in Fort Worth, Avila stood out to the Rams’ front office and coaching staff for his communication up front, his ability to play multiple positions and, most of all, his toughness.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be glass eaters or anything like that,” offensive line coach Ryan Wendell said. “But if you want to be an NFL offensive lineman, you have to be looking for contact on every play. That’s what we saw from Steve on film. He’s got no problem putting his face in and hitting people.”</p>
<p>Though they considered moving up into the first round, the Rams stayed put at the 36th overall pick. Avila was at the top of their board when Day 2 of the NFL draft began, and they scooped him up when their turn on the clock came.</p>
<p>Now preparing for his rookie year, Avila reminds himself that he doesn’t have to worry about returning to class in a couple of weeks. All of his time can be devoted to his craft and learning the Rams’ offense.</p>
<p>“This is literally all I’m doing. It’s a lot easier to go back and watch film for a little more time, it’s a lot easier to go over the plays a little more,” Avila said. “It’s a lot more weight off your shoulders.”</p>
<p>There’s still the adjustment. It’s still football, but Avila is taking in new techniques and finding his footing in the NFL speed of play, and against tougher competition.</p>
<p>“Steve still has a long way to go, like we all do,” Wendell said. “But he approaches it the right way every day in the sense that that guy comes, it’s never too big for him, he’s got a real level personality. Each day he’s taking in notes, he’s working on little things and you see improvement daily.”</p>
<p>“I just want to help the team where I can and I feel like I was drafted for a reason and I feel like that was to start and to contribute,” Avila said. “At the end of the day, I just want to be great. I’ve got people back home I want to make proud, I’ve got expectations for myself.”</p>
<p>And there’s no better teacher for Avila than daily sessions against Donald as he prepares for his first taste of in-game competition this week with Saturday’s preseason opener against the Chargers.</p>
<p>“If you’re made of the right stuff like Steve is, then you embrace that competition every day,” offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur said. “Yeah, [Donald]’s the best to ever do it inside and I truly believe that, and I think most people believe that. So for [Avila] just to go and battle, don’t try to make stuff up versus Aaron. You got to just go play your game.”</p>
<h4 class="">BRIEFLY</h4>
<p>Right tackle Rob Havenstein was held out of practice with a sore neck as a precautionary measure, per a team spokesperson, while Donald, receiver Van Jefferson and center Brian Allen received veteran rest days.</p>

<p>As people made their way through the Marina Green Park during the last day of the annual Long Beach Pride Festival, they were ready to dance, watch drag shows — and celebrate the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>A rainbow of color washed over downtown Long Beach on Sunday afternoon, Aug. 6, with hundreds — many in extravagant, colorful and glittery outfits — enjoying the final day of Pride weekend, hours after the <a href="https://www.presstelegram.com/2023/08/06/thousands-celebrate-lgbtq-diversity-and-equality-at-long-beach-pride-parade/">traditional parade marched down Ocean Boulevard</a>.</p>
<p>Carlos Gaitan, from North Hollywood, was among the crowd Sunday, donning an ensemble that included four-inch heels with rainbow laces. Pride celebrations like the one in Long Beach provide spaces for many members of the LGBTQ community to dress like their authentic selves, he said.</p>

<p>“This is the only time that I can really put myself together,” Gaitan said. “All this is what you represent, and this is me.”</p>
<p>Gaitan had been looking forward to the festival for months. He was looking forward to seeing one of the musical headliners for the event, acclaimed actress/singer Laura León, at the Fiesta Caliente Stage.</p>
<p>Grammy Award-winning artist Mya was also slated to perform later that evening at the Urban Stage. Throughout the day, attendees also had other entertainment options to enjoy, including DJ sets at stages spread around the festival grounds ranging in genres from Latin to country music.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.presstelegram.com/2023/08/05/revelers-gather-in-downtown-long-beach-to-celebrate-pride/">two-day Long Beach Pride Festival</a>, as well as Sunday morning’s parade, has become one of the largest LGBTQ events in the region since its inception in the early 1980s. This year’s event also celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Long Beach Pride nonprofit that started it all.</p>
<p>But for some people, this year was the first time they had attended the popular festivities.</p>
<p>Amy Saenz and May Nelson, from San Clemente, said they were enjoying their first time at both the parade and festival</p>
<p>“It’s amazing,” Saenz said. “We went to the parade, which was pretty fun and we’ve enjoyed the Drag Dome. Pride is about being who you want to be without being judged.”</p>
<p>The Drag Dome was a new addition to the festival’s happenings this year. It featured acts from Mayhem Miller, Jasmine Masters, Delta Work, April Carrion, Militia Scunt and Honey Davenport. There was also a drag queen story time section for children.</p>
<p>The festival also featured a Family Fun Zone, which had activities that children and their parents could enjoy, as well as a Senior Fun Zone, which offered LGBTQ folks over 65 activities such as karaoke.</p>
<p>There was something for everyone to enjoy, including multiple rows of vendors, diverse food stands, and information booths.</p>
<p>People of all ages also enjoyed the festival.</p>
<p>Graciela Alvarez and her granddaughter, Lupita Serrano, attended Sunday with their family from Wilmington, for example. This was Lupita’s first time at Pride and they took the time to visit each booth.</p>
<p>“For me, it’s really beautiful to see everyone,” Alvarez said. “It’s also really fun because we’re sharing with the community and we’re learning and informing ourselves about the community. I come to support everyone.”</p>
<p>For many members of the LGBTQ community, the festival was not only a time of celebration but was a reminder to continue advocating and fighting for the rights of the community. Many performers on the festival stages also reminded attendees of that sentiment.</p>
<p>Angel Elizalde, from Los Angeles, said that working with LGBTQ youth at the nonprofit Latino Equity Alliance, made him appreciate welcoming spaces such as the Long Beach Pride Festival, especially with recent attacks on the community.</p>
<p>Anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and legislation have spiked dramatically in recent years. Since 2022, a slew of Republican-backed anti-gay and anti-transgender legislation has come under consideration, or has already been enacted, in statehouses nationwide.</p>
<p>This year, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a record 520 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in various state legislatures — 220 of which specifically target transgender and non-binary people.</p>
<p>Of those, 70 bills —which ban gender-affirming care for trans kids, allow students to be misgendered, target drag performances, facilitate discrimination against LGBTQ people and censor LGBTQ curriculum — have already been enacted as of May, the HRC said.</p>
<p>Hate crimes are also on the rise, according to HRC. Since January, 15 transgender and gender-nonconforming people have been killed by violent means — the majority of whom were Black trans women.</p>
<p>“It’s really important to highlight the issues that are going on right now; all the bills that are going on right now against our community are really impactful,” Elizalde said. “If we keep up with the education of our community, we’ll create safer spaces for everyone like (at the festival). But for today, we celebrate our differences.”</p>

<p>A firefighting helicopter crashed in Cabazon on Sunday evening after a midair collision with another helicopter fighting the same fire, killing all three crew members aboard, authorities said. The other helicopter managed to land safely.</p>
<p>Those killed aboard what was described as an observer Bell helicopter were a Cal Fire division chief, a Cal Fire captain and a contract pilot, said Cal Fire Southern Region Chief David Fulcher. He and other fire personnel wore black tape over their badges during a midnight news conference as they mourned the department’s loss.</p>
<p>A Sikorsky S-64 helicopter, better known as a “Skycrane,” with two aboard was able to land safely following the collision, Fulcher said.</p>
<p>“While engaged in the firefight, two helicopters collided,” he said. “Tragically, all three members perished” who were aboard the helicopter that crashed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BREAKING</a>: A firefighting helicopter was involved in a mid-air collision while battling a fire in Riverside County.  <a href="https://t.co/dz8LGL1c9I">https://t.co/dz8LGL1c9I</a></p>
<p>— KCAL News (@kcalnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/kcalnews/status/1688389153879105536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2023</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“This was a tragic loss for the community, the fire service community at Cal Fire and the Riverside County Fire Department,” Fulcher said.</p>
<p>“While this was a tragic event, we are thankful it wasn’t worse,” he said. “The individuals in the first helicopter were able to land safely without incident and no one else was hurt.</p>
<p>“We think about this and how it affects the families. We have lost three great individuals. Three fathers. Three husbands. Three friends. Three sons,” he said.</p>
<p>After the crash, emergency personnel were called to the area near Apache Trail and Bonita Avenue/Pipeline Road around 7:20 p.m. for an air emergency, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department. Cabazon is a community along the 10 Freeway east of Banning. The crash happened south of the 10.</p>

<p>The helicopters had been called to a nearby fire that Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department crews were battling near Broadway and Esperanza avenues. It started in a structure around 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The skies were mostly clear in the area early Sunday evening, with wind speeds ranging from 9 to 14 mph and gusts of 17 to 25 mph, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Mark Moede.</p>
<p>The Broadway fire was measured at about three acres and its forward rate of spread had been stopped by 7:13 p.m., Cal Fire/Riverside said.</p>
<p>A second fire caused by the helicopter crash was stopped at four acres, Fulcher said.</p>
<p>Both helicopters were under contract to work for Cal Fire.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the crash.</p>

<p>COSTA MESA — Chargers coach Brandon Staley made his recruiting pitch to free agent linebacker Eric Kendricks while Kendricks was vacationing in Hawaii. Their conversation, as Staley recalled, could have gone on for hours, but he cut it short because, well, Kendricks was in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Aloha, Mr. Kendricks.</p>
<p>Drue Tranquill had signed with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, one of the Chargers’ AFC West rivals, and there was a job opening at a key position. Staley said he always thought highly of Kendricks while Kendricks was playing with the Minnesota Vikings for eight seasons.</p>
<p>“There’s some times where you just feel like you’ve known someone a lot longer than you have, and he’s one of those players that I had never coached, but I felt like I knew his game,” Staley said. “A couple of my really good friends coached him. I thought, ‘Hey, man, one day if I get to coach this guy, this would be fantastic.’”</p>
<p>So, Staley reached out to Kendricks during the offseason.</p>
<p>“I think what we just were able to do is listen to one another, get to know each other on a personal level, kind of rewind, take me back to Fresno all the way to now,” Staley said of tracing Kendricks’ San Joaquin Valley roots. “Take me through some of those games that we played against each other in Minnesota, when I was in Chicago and Denver, even when I was the head coach here.</p>
<p>“I just think that what he was looking for and what we were looking for was just the perfect fit. Those stars aligned. An hour flies by and it could have been two or three hours, easy.”</p>
<p>Kendricks, a former UCLA standout, signed a two-year, $13.25 million contract. So far, through spring practices and the opening two weeks of training camp, he’s been everything Staley believed he could be, and then some. Staley and Kendricks’ teammates praise him at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Tranquill was one of the Chargers’ defensive leaders in the 2022 season – off the field and especially on it, with a team-best 146 tackles, including 95 solo. Kendricks, a Pro Bowl selection while with the Vikings in 2019, has stepped into a similar role as an experienced leader on and off the field, according to Staley.</p>
<p>“You can’t put a price on it,” Staley said. “There are just things that he’s seen that a lot of these other guys haven’t. You just see that confidence because he’s been through the big games. He’s been through all these tough challenges that you have to face, and not only hasn’t been thrown, but he’s been one of the top players in his position in the NFL. He’s had a real impact on our group.</p>
<p>“We just have to keep working together. There’s a long way to go before where we expect to be. But he’s just a really good guy to go through the process with.”</p>
<h4 class="">SCRIMMAGE HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<p>Defense dominated the Chargers’ scrimmage Sunday at Jack Hammett Sports Complex. Defensive back Mark Webb Jr. intercepted a pass by backup quarterback Easton Stick and then recovered a fumble on the next play. Alohi Gilman had a diving interception of a deflected Justin Herbert pass. …</p>
<p>The Chargers’ offense was hamstrung to a degree by the absence of tackles Rashawn Slater, who has been sidelined for the past three days by an illness, and Trey Pipkins, who has been limited at times by an undisclosed injury. Pipkins participated in some but not all of the scrimmage. …</p>
<p>Cameron Dicker made field goals of 33, 35, 37, 40 and 43 yards. He also kicked a 33-yard field goal to cap Herbert’s drive during a two-minute drill. Dicker has handled all of the kicking duties the past few days because Dustin Hopkins is working through an undisclosed injury, according to Staley. …</p>
<p>Rookie wide receiver Quentin Johnston, a first-round draft pick from TCU, joined the list of players unavailable to practice over the past few days because of an illness. Slater, edge rusher Joey Bosa and tight end Gerald Everett also have missed practices because of an unspecified illness.</p>
